# GazeTracker
Tracker that uses AI to track the orientation and position of your face using a webcam

Shameless copy from the examples of Tadas API [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace)  
The idea is to make it work with [OpenTrack](https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack) trough UDP

## Download:
 Just go to the [releases](../../releases) page

## Building:

1: You need to run the `download_models.ps1` script to download the AI models.  
2: Build it with visual studio and make sure that the `Libs` content is copied to the output
